## üìã Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an AI-powered system for detecting and classifying invasive fish species in the Mediterranean Sea. The project utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, combining YOLOv9 for object detection and various CNN architectures for classification.

## üöÄ Features

### üîç Fish Detection
- Advanced fish detection using YOLOv9 object detection model
- Real-time processing capabilities
- High accuracy in complex underwater environments
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics including mAP

### üéØ Fish Classification
- Multi-model approach using:
  - DenseNet (94.45% accuracy)
  - GoogLeNet (94.17% accuracy)
  - ResNet (92.77% accuracy)
  - VGG-19 (90.80% accuracy)
- Transfer learning optimization
- Robust performance on underwater imagery
